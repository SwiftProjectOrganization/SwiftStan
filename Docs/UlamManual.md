# Ulam Manual


## 1. Purpose

This manual walks through a set of example models, illustrating the steps in three different workflows:

1. **Forward file-based workflow**:
```
stancode  →  csv2json  →  compile  →  sample
```
This is the basic workflow for using the ulam port followed by the cmdstan steps `compile` and `sample`. All steps can be combined in a single command:
```
swiftstan ulam --model <name>
```

2. **Forward DSL/swiftc based workflow**:
```
alist2dsl → dsl2stan (swiftc based) → compile → sample
```
The DSL/swiftc workflow is described in the DSLManula.md.


3. **Reverse workflow**:
```
stan2alist
```
This step "closes the loop", it attempts to translate a .stan file back into a .alist.r file, see an example in §5.2 (radon_pp).
 
---

## 2. File system setup

### 1. Top level case structure

Every case lives in its own directory under `~/Documents/<STAN_CASES>/<name>/`,
split into inputs and outputs:

```
~/Documents/StanCases/<name>/
├── Preliminaries/        inputs you provide
│   ├── <name>.alist.r    the model, in McElreath alist() form
│   └── <name>.csv        the data
└── Results/              everything the pipeline generates
    ├── <name>.stan       generated Stan source
    ├── <name>            compiled cmdstan binary
    └── <name>.<method>.log / .error.log
```

The model description in `"<name>.alist.r"` borrows McElreath's `alist()` notation from the `rethinking` R package.

By convention **the first `~` line is the likelihood**; the remaining
`~` lines are priors. This convention drives how the parser assigns roles when it
lowers the `alist()` into a Stan program.

Subcommands fill out the case structure, e.g.:

| Command | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `swiftstan stancode --model <name>` | `Preliminaries/<name>.alist.r` | `Results/<name>.stan` |
| `swiftstan compile --model <name>` | `Results/<name>.stan` | `Results/<name>` (binary) + compile logs |
| `swiftstan csv2json --model <name> | `Preliminaries/<name>.csv` | `Results/<name>.data.json` |
|---|---|---|

`stancode` runs entirely in-process (no `swiftc`, no cmdstan). `compile` shells out to cmdstan's `make` to translate the Stan source to C++ and build a native binary. `csv2json` creates the data input file needed for running the Stan Language Program.

### 2.2. Reverse direction: `stan2alist`

`swiftstan stan2alist --model <name>` is the inverse of `stancode`: it reads
`Results/<name>.stan` and writes a McElreath `alist()` to
`Preliminaries/<name>.alist.R`. It also runs in-process. Use it to recover an
editable `alist()` from a hand-written or generated Stan file.

It targets a round-trip workflow, but with limitations (currently).

In the case of the radon_pp exmple, the declaration
constraints (`<lower=0>`), half-Cauchy `T[0, ]` suffixes, and `<offset>`/
`<multiplier>` affine non-centering are dropped on the way back — they are
re-derived (or are semantically equivalent to the centred form) when
`stancode` regenerates the Stan, so `stancode → stan2alist → stancode`
round-trips byte-for-byte for vectorising models — and for contract-loop models
(e.g. chimpanzees' `vector * vector` term), whose single `for (i in 1:N) { lhs[i]
= rhs; }` emission the parser inverts by de-subscripting the body back to the
vectorised assignment (see `Docs/LoopEmissionPlan.md`). `generated quantities`
and `transformed *` blocks have no `alist()` form and are dropped with a warning;
off-contract loops (`while`, multi-statement/recursive bodies) and multivariate
distributions are out of scope and fail loud.

It refuses to overwrite an existing `.alist.R` unless `--force` is given.

As stated in the README.md, the reverse workflow is an "experiment within an experiment".

## 3. Simple examples

### 3.1 Radon complete-pooling example

#### 3.1.1 About the radon example

The radon dataset is a multilevel example: measurements
of indoor radon gas concentration in homes, recorded together with the floor on
which the measurement was taken (basement vs. first floor). In its full form it is the textbook varying-intercept-by-county model, see [ARM](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/arm/).

The version used here is the **simplest** form — a complete-pooling linear regression of log-radon on the floor indicator, with no grouping:

```
log_radon ~ Normal(alpha + beta * floor, sigma)
```

This makes it an ideal first end-to-end example: one likelihood, three priors, no
indexing.

#### 3.1.2 The `Preliminaries` directory and `stancode`

The radon case starts with these inputs:

```
~/Documents/StanCases/radon/Preliminaries/
├── radon.alist.r
└── radon.csv
```

The model description, `radon.alist.r`, is a direct transcription of McElreath's
`alist()` format of the complete-pooling model:

```r
alist(
	log_radon ~ dnorm(alpha + beta * floor, sigma),
	alpha ~ dnorm(0, 10),
	beta ~ dnorm(0, 10),
	sigma ~ dnorm(0, 10)
)
```

The first line is the likelihood (`log_radon`), and the three following lines are
priors on `alpha`, `beta`, and `sigma`.

> Note on filename case: the file on disk is `radon.alist.r` (lowercase `.r`). The
> CLI resolves `Preliminaries/<name>.alist.R`; on macOS's case-insensitive APFS the
> two match.

Generate the Stan source:

```bash
swiftstan stancode --model radon
```

This reads `Preliminaries/radon.alist.R`, runs the alist parser → lowering →
classify → `UlamModel` → `stancode` chain in-process, and writes
`Results/radon.stan`. On success it prints:

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/radon/Results/radon.stan
```

The generated `Results/radon.stan`:

```stan
// Generated by SwiftStan ulam port.
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  vector[N] floor;
  vector[N] log_radon;
}
parameters {
  real alpha;
  real beta;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
}
model {
  alpha ~ normal(0, 10);
  beta ~ normal(0, 10);
  sigma ~ normal(0, 10) T[0, ];
  log_radon ~ normal(alpha + beta*floor, sigma);
}
```

A few things the generator inferred automatically:

- `N` and the `vector[N]` data columns (`floor`, `log_radon`) were derived from the
  variables referenced in the model.
- `sigma` was given a `<lower=0>` constraint and its prior was truncated at zero
  (`T[0, ]`), because a standard deviation must be positive.
- `dnorm` was mapped to Stan's `normal`.

#### 3.1.3 Running `compile` and the updated `Results` directory

Compile the generated Stan program into a native cmdstan binary:

```bash
swiftstan compile --model radon
```

This reads `Results/radon.stan` and invokes `/usr/bin/make` inside the cmdstan
directory, which runs three stages: translate Stan → C++ (`stanc`), compile the C++
(`clang++`), and link the model. On success it prints:

```
→ Command /usr/bin/make completed successfully.
```

After compilation, `Results/` contains the binary and the captured build logs:

```
~/Documents/StanCases/radon/Results/
├── radon                      compiled binary (~2.5 MB)
├── radon.compile.error.log    captured stderr
├── radon.compile.log          captured stdout (the build transcript)
└── radon.stan
```

The intermediate `radon.hpp` and `radon.o` files produced during the build are
removed by cmdstan's Makefile once linking succeeds. If compilation goes well, the
`radon.compile.error.log` file is empty.

The full build transcript is saved to `radon.compile.log`:

```bash
--- Translating Stan model to C++ code ---
bin/stanc --warn-pedantic --O1 --o=.../Results/radon.hpp .../Results/radon.stan

--- Compiling C++ code ---
clang++ -std=c++17 ... -c -include-pch .../model_header_threads_21_0.hpp.gch \
    -x c++ -o .../Results/radon.o .../Results/radon.hpp

--- Linking model ---
clang++ -std=c++17 ... .../Results/radon.o src/cmdstan/main_threads.o \
    -ltbb ... -o .../Results/radon
rm .../Results/radon.o .../Results/radon.hpp
```

(The real log lines are long absolute paths and full compiler flag lists; they are abbreviated above for readability. The logs overwrite on each run — copy them aside if you want a historical record.)

#### 3.1.4 Preparing the data with `csv2json`

cmdstan reads its input data as JSON, not CSV. The `csv2json` subcommand reads the
raw `Preliminaries/<name>.csv`, validates it against the data block of the generated
`Results/<name>.stan`, and writes a cmdstan-ready `Results/<name>.data.json`.

The first five lines of `radon.csv` (a header row plus four data rows):

```
,idnum,state,zip,region,typebldg,floor,room,basement,county,Uppm,log_radon
0,5081.0,MN,55735,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,N,AITKIN,0.502054,0.8329091229351040
1,5082.0,MN,55748,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,Y,AITKIN,0.502054,0.8329091229351040
2,5083.0,MN,55748,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,Y,AITKIN,0.502054,1.0986122886681100
3,5084.0,MN,56469,5.0,1.0,0.0,4.0,Y,AITKIN,0.502054,0.09531017980432490
```

The CSV has many columns, but the model only references `floor` and `log_radon`.
`csv2json` pulls exactly the columns named in the `.stan` data block, derives the row
count `N`, and ignores the rest.

```bash
swiftstan csv2json --model radon
```

On success it prints:

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/radon/Results/radon.data.json
```

An abbreviated view of the resulting `Results/radon.data.json` (the two data vectors
are 919 elements each — elided here with `…`):

```json
{
  "floor" : [
    1,
    0,
    0,
    …
  ],
  "log_radon" : [
    0.832909122935104,
    0.832909122935104,
    1.09861228866811,
    …
    1.09861228866811
  ],
  "N" : 919
}
```

Notes:

- Only `floor` and `log_radon` appear — the columns referenced by the model — plus
  the derived `N` (919 rows). Unreferenced CSV columns (`state`, `zip`, `county`, …)
  are dropped.
- `csv2json` fails loudly on `NA` values in any required column rather than emitting
  silent gaps.

`Results/` now holds the compiled binary, the Stan source, the build logs, and the
data file — everything cmdstan needs to sample:

```
~/Documents/StanCases/radon/Results/
├── radon                      compiled binary
├── radon.compile.error.log
├── radon.compile.log
├── radon.data.json            ← new: cmdstan input data
└── radon.stan
```

With the binary and `radon.data.json` in place, the model is ready for sampling.

#### 3.1.5 Sampling with `sample` (and `stansummary`)

The `sample` subcommand runs the compiled binary's NUTS sampler against
`Results/radon.data.json`. By default it runs **four chains of 1000 post-warmup
draws**, cleans the per-chain output into a single samples file, and then **also runs
`stansummary`** to produce convergence diagnostics — all in one invocation.

```bash
swiftstan sample --model radon
```

Output:

```
Command `/Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/radon/Results/radon sample` completed successfully.

→ Wrote cleaned radon.stansummary.csv (raw radon_stansummary.csv preserved)
```

The bundled `stansummary` step writes a human-readable table to
`Results/radon.stansummary.log`:

```

Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
```

The three model parameters have converged cleanly (`R_hat ≈ 1.00`, healthy effective
sample sizes, no divergences): `alpha ≈ 1.36`, `beta ≈ -0.59` (homes measured on the
first floor read lower than basements), and `sigma ≈ 0.79`.

The same statistics, in machine-readable form, are written to the cleaned
`Results/radon.stansummary.csv`:

```csv

```

(In the cleaned CSV, cmdstan's `nan` diagnostic entries — e.g. `stepsize__`'s MCSE —
are replaced with the sentinel `-100000`.)

After sampling, `Results/` holds the raw cmdstan output, the cleaned files this CLI
produces, and the per-method logs:

```
~/Documents/StanCases/radon/Results/
├── radon                       compiled binary
├── radon.stan
├── radon.data.json
├── radon_output_1.csv          raw per-chain draws (one file per chain)
├── radon_output_2.csv
├── radon_output_3.csv
├── radon_output_4.csv

├── radon.sample.log / .error.log
├── radon.stansummary.log / .error.log
└── radon.compile.log / .error.log
```

The two **cleaned** files — `radon.samples.csv` and `radon.stansummary.csv` — are the
contract consumed by downstream tools (such as the
[SwiftStats](https://github.com/SwiftProjectOrganization/SwiftStats) package).

> Pass `-S` / `--nosummary` to skip the bundled `stansummary` step, or run
> `swiftstan stansummary --model radon` separately. Trailing `key=value` arguments
> (e.g. `num_chains=8 num_samples=2000`) are passed straight through to cmdstan.

### 3.2 Bernoulli example

#### 3.2.1 About the bernoulli example

The bernoulli example is the simplest model in this manual: a single binary outcome
`y` (0 or 1) drawn from a Bernoulli with one shared success probability `theta`, and
a flat prior on that probability:

```
y ~ Bernoulli(theta)
theta ~ Uniform(0, 1)
```

There are no predictors and no link function — just one parameter to estimate. It is
the classic Statistical Rethinking "globe tossing" model and a good first sanity
check for the whole pipeline.

#### 3.2.2 The `Preliminaries` directory and `stancode`

The bernoulli_1 case starts with these inputs:

```
~/Documents/StanCases/bernoulli_1/Preliminaries/
├── bernoulli_1.alist.r
└── bernoulli_1.csv
```

The model description, `bernoulli_1.alist.r`:

```r
alist(
  y ~ dbern(theta),
  theta ~ dunif(0, 1)
)
```

The first line is the likelihood (`y`); the second is a uniform prior on `theta`.

Generate the Stan source:

```bash
swiftstan stancode --model bernoulli_1
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/bernoulli_1/Results/bernoulli_1.stan
```

The generated `Results/bernoulli_1.stan`:

```stan
// Generated by SwiftStan ulam port.
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  array[N] int<lower=0, upper=1> y;
}
parameters {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta;
}
model {
  theta ~ uniform(0, 1);
  y ~ bernoulli(theta);
}
```

What the generator inferred:

- `y` is a binary outcome, so it is emitted as an integer array constrained to
  `<lower=0, upper=1>` — exactly the 0/1 support of a Bernoulli.
- `theta` is a probability, so its parameter declaration carries
  `<lower=0, upper=1>`, matching the `Uniform(0, 1)` prior.
- `dbern` → Stan's `bernoulli`, `dunif` → `uniform`.

#### 3.2.3 Running `compile`

Compile the generated Stan program:

```bash
swiftstan compile --model bernoulli_1
```

If the binary already exists, `compile` skips the (slow) cmdstan build:

```
→ Found existing binary. Skipping compilation.
```

On a fresh case it instead invokes `/usr/bin/make` and reports
`→ Command /usr/bin/make completed successfully.`, writing the `bernoulli_1` binary
and `bernoulli_1.compile.log` / `.error.log` into `Results/` (cf. §3.1.3).

#### 3.2.4 Preparing the data with `csv2json`

The first six lines of `bernoulli_1.csv` (header plus five of the ten rows):

```
"","y"
"1",0
"2",1
"3",0
"4",1
"5",1
```

Convert it to cmdstan's JSON form:

```bash
swiftstan csv2json --model bernoulli_1
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/bernoulli_1/Results/bernoulli_1.data.json
```

The full `Results/bernoulli_1.data.json` (10 rows):

```json
{
  "N" : 10,
  "y" : [ 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0 ]
}
```

(The `y` array is written one element per line in the actual file; condensed here for
brevity. The values stay integers, matching the `array[N] int` declaration.)

#### 3.2.5 Sampling with `sample` (and `stansummary`)

```bash
swiftstan sample --model bernoulli_1
```

```
Command `/Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/bernoulli_1/Results/bernoulli_1 sample` completed successfully.

→ Wrote cleaned bernoulli_1.stansummary.csv (raw bernoulli_1_stansummary.csv preserved)

Clean convergence (`R_hat ≈ 1.00`, no divergences). The single parameter
`theta ≈ 0.59` recovers the observed success rate — 6 ones out of the 10 rows — with
a posterior 5–95% interval of roughly `0.35` to `0.81`, reflecting the small sample.

### 3.3 Binomial example

#### 3.3.1 About the binomial example

The binomial example is a small **aggregated logistic regression**. Each row records
the number of `successes` out of a fixed number of `trials`, along with a predictor
`x`. The success probability `theta` varies with `x` through a `logit` link:

```
successes ~ Binomial(trials, theta)
logit(theta) = a + b * x
```

This is the natural generalisation of the Bernoulli case (§3.2): instead of one 0/1
outcome per row, each row is a count of successes out of `trials` independent
Bernoulli draws. It exercises two features the radon example does not — an **integer
array outcome** and a **link function** in the model.

#### 3.3.2 The `Preliminaries` directory and `stancode`

The binomial case starts with these inputs:

```
~/Documents/StanCases/binomial/Preliminaries/
├── binomial.alist.r
└── binomial.csv
```

The model description, `binomial.alist.r`:

```r
alist(
    successes ~ dbinom(trials, theta),
    logit(theta) <- a + b * x,
    a ~ dnorm(0, 4),
    b ~ dnorm(0, 1)
)
```

The first line is the likelihood (`successes`); the `logit(theta) <- ...` line is a
deterministic link; and `a`, `b` get normal priors.

Generate the Stan source:

```bash
swiftstan stancode --model binomial
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/binomial/Results/binomial.stan
```

The generated `Results/binomial.stan`:

```stan
// Generated by SwiftStan ulam port.
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  array[N] int<lower=0> successes;
  array[N] int trials;
  vector[N] x;
}
transformed data {
  for (i in 1:N) {
    if (successes[i] > trials[i]) {
      reject("successes[", i, "] = ", successes[i],
             " > trials[", i, "] = ", trials[i],
             " — binomial outcome must satisfy y[i] <= trials[i]");
    }
  }
}
parameters {
  real a;
  real b;
}
model {
  vector[N] theta;
  theta = inv_logit(a + b*x);
  a ~ normal(0, 4);
  b ~ normal(0, 1);
  successes ~ binomial(trials, theta);
}
```

What the generator produced here that radon did not:

- `successes` and `trials` are emitted as **integer arrays** (`array[N] int`), not
  `vector[N]` — binomial counts are integers. `successes` also carries `<lower=0>`.
- A `transformed data` block with a **guard** that rejects any row where
  `successes[i] > trials[i]`, since that is impossible under a binomial.
- The `logit(theta) <- ...` link became a `theta` vector computed with `inv_logit`
  in the `model` block (the inverse of the `logit` link).

#### 3.3.3 Running `compile`

Compile the generated Stan program:

```bash
swiftstan compile --model binomial
```

```
→ Command `/usr/bin/make (binomial executable)` completed successfully.
```

This writes the `binomial` binary plus `binomial.compile.log` /
`binomial.compile.error.log` into `Results/`, exactly as for radon (§3.1.3).

#### 3.3.4 Preparing the data with `csv2json`

The first six lines of `binomial.csv` (header plus five data rows):

```
"","successes","trials","x"
"1",2,5,0.1
"2",3,5,0.2
"3",1,5,0.3
"4",4,5,0.4
"5",5,10,0.5
```

Convert it to cmdstan's JSON form:

```bash
swiftstan csv2json --model binomial
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/binomial/Results/binomial.data.json
```

The full `Results/binomial.data.json` (this dataset has only 8 rows):

```json
{
  "N" : 8,
  "successes" : [ 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ],
  "trials" : [ 5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10 ],
  "x" : [ 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 ]
}
```

(The arrays are written one element per line in the actual file; they are condensed
here for brevity. `successes` and `trials` are emitted as integers, matching the
`array[N] int` declarations in the `.stan` schema.)

#### 3.3.5 Sampling with `sample` (and `stansummary`)

```bash
swiftstan sample --model binomial
```

```
Command `/Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/binomial/Results/binomial sample` completed successfully.

Clean convergence (`R_hat ≈ 1.00`, no divergences). The slope `b ≈ 0.92` indicates
that the success probability increases with `x`, while the intercept `a ≈ -0.06` is

### 3.4 Howell — the whole pipeline in one `ulam` command

#### 3.4.1 About the howell example

The first three examples ran each pipeline step by hand
(`stancode → csv2json → compile → sample`) to show what each one does. In practice you
rarely run them individually — the **`ulam`** subcommand chains them all, re-running
only the steps whose inputs changed (make-style staleness checks).

The model is McElreath's chapter-4 height model — the simplest possible Gaussian:

```
height ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
mu    ~ Normal(178, 20)
sigma ~ Uniform(0, 50)
```

#### 3.4.2 The `Preliminaries` directory

```
~/Documents/StanCases/howell/Preliminaries/
├── howell.alist.R
└── howell.csv
```

The model description, `howell.alist.R`:

```r
flist <- alist(
    height ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ) ,
    mu ~ dnorm( 178 , 20 ) ,
    sigma ~ dunif( 0 , 50 )
)
```

(`ulam` reads the `alist(...)` whether or not it's wrapped in an `flist <- …`
assignment.) The `howell.csv` has a `height` column — the only one the model
references — alongside an unused `height_std`.

#### 3.4.3 Running the whole pipeline with `ulam`

```bash
swiftstan ulam --model howell
```

`ulam` runs the full chain in order, compiling and sampling in one invocation:

```
Compiling...
Command `/usr/bin/make (howell executable)` completed successfully.
Command `/Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/howell/Results/howell sample` completed successfully.

→ Wrote cleaned howell.stansummary.csv (raw howell_stansummary.csv preserved)
```

Internally this is exactly the four commands from §3.1–§3.3:

1. `stancode` — `Preliminaries/howell.alist.R` → `Results/howell.stan` (the `ulam`
   pipeline prefers the in-process `stancode` path; the alist front-end is the same
   one §3.1 used).
2. `csv2json` — `Preliminaries/howell.csv` + the `.stan` schema → `Results/howell.data.json`.
3. `compile` — `Results/howell.stan` → the `howell` binary (`Compiling…`).
4. `sample` — runs the binary and writes the cleaned samples + stansummary.

Each step has a make-style staleness check, so a second `ulam` run with no edits
reuses the up-to-date `.stan`, data JSON, and binary, re-running only what's needed.

#### 3.4.4 What `ulam` produced

The generated `Results/howell.stan`:

```stan
// Generated by SwiftStan ulam port.
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  vector[N] height;
}
parameters {
  real mu;
  real<lower=0, upper=50> sigma;
}
model {
  mu ~ normal(178, 20);
  sigma ~ uniform(0, 50);
  height ~ normal(mu, sigma);
}
```

Note `sigma` picked up a `<lower=0, upper=50>` declaration constraint from its
`Uniform(0, 50)` prior (a uniform prior is improper unless the parameter is declared on
the same interval) — the natural-support inference §3.1 mentioned. The data JSON holds
just the referenced column and the derived row count (`height`, `N = 1000`); the unused
`height_std` is dropped.

```

After running, `Results/` holds the same set of files the hand-run pipeline produces
(§3.1.5), with `howell.*` filenames — `ulam` just generates them in one step.

---

## 4. Intermediate examples

The simple models in §3 had only scalar parameters. The intermediate examples
introduce **grouped (indexed) parameters** — a separate coefficient per level of some
grouping factor — which exercise the pipeline's index-column handling and
string-to-integer factorisation.

### 4.1 Radon — no pooling

#### 4.1.1 About the no-pooling radon model

§3.1 fit a single intercept `alpha` shared by every home — *complete pooling*. The
**no-pooling** model goes to the opposite extreme: it gives each of the 85 Minnesota
counties its own independent intercept `alpha[county]`, while keeping a single shared
floor slope `beta`:

```
log_radon ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
mu = alpha[county] + beta * floor
alpha[county] ~ Normal(0, 10)   (one per county, estimated independently)
```

"No pooling" because the county intercepts share no common hyper-distribution — each
is estimated only from that county's own homes. (The middle ground, *partial
pooling*, where the `alpha[county]` draw from a learned hyper-prior, is the subject
of a later section.)

This is the first model with a **vector-valued parameter** and an **index column**.

#### 4.1.2 The `Preliminaries` directory and `stancode`

```
~/Documents/StanCases/radon_np/Preliminaries/
├── radon_np.alist.r
└── radon_np.csv
```

The model description, `radon_np.alist.r`:

```r
alist(
	log_radon ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- alpha[county] + beta * floor,
	alpha[county] ~ dnorm(0, 10),
	beta ~ dnorm(0, 10),
	sigma ~ dnorm(0, 10)
)
```

The `[county]` subscript on `alpha` is what makes this a grouped model: it tells the
generator that `alpha` is a vector with one entry per distinct value of the `county`
column, indexed row-by-row.

Generate the Stan source:

```bash
swiftstan stancode --model radon_np
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/radon_np/Results/radon_np.stan
```

The generated `Results/radon_np.stan`:

```stan
// Generated by SwiftStan ulam port.
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  int<lower=1> N_county;
  array[N] int<lower=1, upper=N_county> county;
  vector[N] floor;
  vector[N] log_radon;
}
parameters {
  vector[N_county] alpha;
  real beta;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
}
model {
  vector[N] mu;
  mu = alpha[county] + beta*floor;
  alpha ~ normal(0, 10);
  beta ~ normal(0, 10);
  sigma ~ normal(0, 10) T[0, ];
  log_radon ~ normal(mu, sigma);
}
```

What the `[county]` subscript produced that the §3.1 model did not:

- A **cardinality** `N_county` and an **index array** `county` declared as
  `array[N] int<lower=1, upper=N_county>` — one 1-based county index per row.
- `alpha` is now a `vector[N_county]`, not a scalar `real`.
- `alpha[county]` in the `mu` expression gathers the per-row intercept by index.
- The single prior `alpha ~ normal(0, 10)` is applied to the whole vector at once —
  all 85 intercepts share the same prior but are otherwise independent.

#### 4.1.3 Running `compile`

```bash
swiftstan compile --model radon_np
```

```
→ Command `/usr/bin/make (radon_np executable)` completed successfully.
```

Writes the `radon_np` binary and the compile logs into `Results/`, as in §3.1.3.

#### 4.1.4 Preparing the data with `csv2json`

The `radon_np.csv` is the full 31-column radon dataset. The model only references
three of those columns — `county`, `floor`, `log_radon` — shown abbreviated below:

```
... county   ... floor ... log_radon
... "AITKIN"  ...   1   ... 0.832909122935104
... "AITKIN"  ...   0   ... 0.832909122935104
... "AITKIN"  ...   0   ... 1.09861228866811
... "AITKIN"  ...   0   ... 0.0953101798043249
... "ANOKA"   ...   0   ... 1.16315080980568
```

Note that `county` holds **strings** (`"AITKIN"`, `"ANOKA"`, …), not integers.

```bash
swiftstan csv2json --model radon_np
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/radon_np/Results/radon_np.data.json
```

`csv2json` **factorises** the string `county` column into 1-based integer indices and
emits the matching cardinality `N_county`:

```json
{
  "county" : [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, … ],
  "floor" : [ … ],
  "log_radon" : [ … ],
  "N" : 919,
  "N_county" : 85
}
```

The 85 distinct county names map to `county` indices `1…85` (`AITKIN → 1`,
`ANOKA → 2`, …), and `N_county = 85` matches the `int<lower=1> N_county` the `.stan`
schema expects. This string-column factorisation is what lets an `alist()` index by a
human-readable name rather than a pre-encoded integer.

#### 4.1.5 Sampling with `sample` (and `stansummary`)

```bash
swiftstan sample --model radon_np
```

```
Command `/Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/radon_np/Results/radon_np sample` completed successfully.

→ Wrote cleaned radon_np.stansummary.csv (raw radon_np_stansummary.csv preserved)
```

The model now has 87 parameters (85 county intercepts, plus `beta` and `sigma`), so
the `stansummary` table is long. Its head and the two shared parameters from
`Results/radon_np.stansummary.log`:

```

Clean convergence across all 87 parameters (`R_hat ≈ 1.00`, no divergences). The
shared slope `beta ≈ -0.69` is close to the complete-pooling estimate from §3.1
(`-0.59`), confirming that homes measured on the first floor read lower. The
per-county intercepts vary widely — counties with few homes (e.g. `alpha[1]`,
StdDev ≈ 0.37) are estimated far less precisely than data-rich counties (e.g.
`alpha[2]`, StdDev ≈ 0.10), which is exactly the weakness that partial pooling later
addresses.

This is McElreath's prosocial-choice experiment: each row is one lever-pull by one
chimpanzee, and the binary outcome `pulled_left` records which lever it chose. The
model asks whether chimpanzees pull the prosocial option more often, while accounting
for the fact that observations are grouped two ways at once — by the individual
`actor` and by the experimental `block`:

```
pulled_left ~ Binomial(1, p)
logit(p) = a + a_actor[actor] + a_block[block_id] + (bp + bpc·condition)·prosoc_left
a_actor[actor] ~ Normal(0, sigma_actor)
a_block[block_id] ~ Normal(0, sigma_block)
a, bp, bpc       ~ Normal(0, 10)
sigma_actor, sigma_block ~ HalfCauchy(0, 1)
```

It extends §4.1 in three ways: **two** grouping factors instead of one
(*cross-classified*), **partial pooling** (each group's `sigma_*` is a *learned*
hyper-parameter, not a fixed constant), and a non-trivial linear predictor with an
interaction term. This is the most elaborate model in the manual so far.

#### 4.2.2 The `Preliminaries` directory and `stancode`

```
~/Documents/StanCases/chimpanzees/Preliminaries/
├── chimpanzees.alist.R
└── chimpanzees.csv
```

The model description, `chimpanzees.alist.R`:

```r
alist(
    pulled_left ~ dbinom( 1 , p ),
    logit(p) <- a + a_actor[actor] + a_block[block_id] +
                (bp + bpc*condition)*prosoc_left,
    a_actor[actor] ~ dnorm( 0 , sigma_actor ),
    a_block[block_id] ~ dnorm( 0 , sigma_block ),
    c(a,bp,bpc) ~ dnorm(0,10),
    sigma_actor ~ dcauchy(0,1),
    sigma_block ~ dcauchy(0,1)
)
```

Two notational features beyond §4.1: the `c(a,bp,bpc) ~ dnorm(0,10)` shorthand
assigns the **same prior to three parameters** at once, and the two
`a_*[...] ~ dnorm(0, sigma_*)` lines give each varying intercept a prior whose scale
is itself a parameter (`sigma_actor`, `sigma_block`) — the hallmark of partial
pooling.

  sigma_block ~ cauchy(0, 1) T[0, ];
  pulled_left ~ bernoulli(p);
}
```

Things the generator produced here:

- **Two** index pairs — `(N_actor, actor)` and `(N_block_id, block_id)` — with their
  own `vector[N_actor]` / `vector[N_block_id]` intercepts.
- The `c(a,bp,bpc) ~ dnorm(0,10)` line expanded into three separate
  `~ normal(0, 10)` statements for `a`, `bp`, `bpc`.
- `sigma_actor` / `sigma_block` are ordinary `<lower=0>` parameters that appear *as
  the scale* of the `a_actor` / `a_block` priors — the partial-pooling structure.
- Because the linear predictor contains an interaction
  (`(bp + bpc*condition)*prosoc_left`) that mixes indexed and per-row terms, the
  predictor is emitted as an explicit `for (i in 1:N)` loop rather than a single
  vectorised expression.
- `dbinom(1, p)` with one trial collapses to `bernoulli(p)`, and the `logit` link
  becomes `inv_logit`.

#### 4.2.3 Running `compile`

```bash
swiftstan compile --model chimpanzees
```

```
→ Command `/usr/bin/make (chimpanzees executable)` completed successfully.
```

(If the binary is already current, `compile` prints
`→ Found existing binary. Skipping compilation.` instead — see §3.2.3.)

#### 4.2.4 Preparing the data with `csv2json`

The first six lines of `chimpanzees.csv` (header plus five of the 504 rows):

```
"","actor","condition","block_id","trial","prosoc_left","chose_prosoc","pulled_left"
"1",1,0,1,2,0,1,0
"2",1,0,1,4,0,0,1
"3",1,0,1,6,1,0,0
"4",1,0,1,8,0,1,0
"5",1,0,1,10,1,1,1
```

```bash
swiftstan csv2json --model chimpanzees
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/chimpanzees/Results/chimpanzees.data.json
```

The two index columns are already integer-coded in the CSV, so `csv2json` simply
carries them through and derives both cardinalities:

```json
{
  "actor" : [ 1, 1, 1, … ],
  "block_id" : [ 1, 1, 1, … ],
  "condition" : [ … ],
  "prosoc_left" : [ … ],
  "pulled_left" : [ … ],
  "N" : 504,
  "N_actor" : 7,
  "N_block_id" : 6
}
```

There are 7 chimpanzees and 6 experimental blocks, so `N_actor = 7` and
`N_block_id = 6` — matching the two `int<lower=1>` cardinalities in the `.stan`
schema. (Unlike the `radon_np` county column, these are already integers, so no
string factorisation is needed.)

#### 4.2.5 Sampling with `sample` (and `stansummary`)

Convergence is healthy (`R_hat ≈ 1.00` throughout); the effective sample sizes are
smaller than in the simpler models because the hierarchical geometry is harder to
sample. The science matches McElreath's result: the prosocial main effect `bp ≈ 0.84`
is clearly positive, while the interaction `bpc ≈ -0.14` is near zero. Crucially,
`sigma_actor ≈ 2.3` is an order of magnitude larger than `sigma_block ≈ 0.23` — almost
all the variation is between *individuals*, not between *blocks*, and the large
`a_actor[2] ≈ 4.1` is the one chimp that nearly always pulled left.

### 4.3 UCB admissions — partial-pooling binomial GLMM

#### 4.3.1 About the UCB model

This is McElreath's reworking of the famous Berkeley graduate-admissions data. Each
row is one department × gender cell: how many of `applications` resulted in `admit`,
together with a `male` indicator. The model pools admission rates across the six
departments through a learned hyper-prior:

```
admit ~ Binomial(applications, p)
logit(p) = a[dept] + b * male
a[dept] ~ Normal(abar, sigma)    (partial pooling across departments)
abar     ~ Normal(0, 4)
sigma    ~ HalfNormal(0, 1)
b        ~ Normal(0, 1)
```

It combines the two threads from earlier sections: the **aggregated binomial outcome**
of §3.3 and the **partial-pooling** varying intercept of §4.2 — making it the first
binomial *generalised linear mixed model* in the manual. The single gender slope `b`
is shared across all departments.

#### 4.3.2 The `Preliminaries` directory and `stancode`

```
~/Documents/StanCases/ucb/Preliminaries/
├── ucb.alist.R
└── ucb.csv
```

The model description, `ucb.alist.R`:

```r
alist(
	admit ~ dbinom(applications,p),
	logit(p) <- a[dept] + b*male,
	a[dept] ~ dnorm( abar , sigma ),
	abar ~ dnorm( 0 , 4 ),
	sigma ~ dnorm(0, 1),
	b ~ dnorm(0, 1)
)
```

The varying intercept `a[dept]` draws from `dnorm(abar, sigma)` whose mean and scale
are themselves parameters — the partial-pooling signature — while `admit ~ dbinom(...)`
is an aggregated binomial.

  abar ~ normal(0, 4);
  sigma ~ normal(0, 1) T[0, ];
  b ~ normal(0, 1);
  admit ~ binomial(applications, p);
}
```

This single model exercises features from three earlier examples at once:

- The **binomial** outcome gives `admit`/`applications` integer-array declarations and
  the `transformed data` reject-guard (`admit[i] > applications[i]`), exactly as in
  §3.3.
- The **`a[dept]` index** produces `N_dept` and the `array[N] int<lower=1, upper=N_dept>`
  index column, as in §4.1.
- The **partial pooling** makes `abar` and `sigma` the mean/scale of the
  `a ~ normal(abar, sigma)` prior, as in §4.2.
- Unlike the chimpanzees model, the linear predictor has no interaction, so `p` is a
  single vectorised `inv_logit(...)` rather than a `for` loop.

(If the binary is already current, `compile` prints

#### 4.3.4 Preparing the data with `csv2json`

The first eight lines of `ucb.csv` (header plus seven of the 12 rows):

```
"","dept","admit","applications","male"
"1",1,512,825,1
"2",1,89,108,0
"3",2,353,560,1

```

```bash
swiftstan csv2json --model ucb
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/ucb/Results/ucb.data.json
```

The `dept` column is already integer-coded (`1…6`), so `csv2json` carries it through
and derives the cardinality:

```json
{
  "admit" : [ 512, 89, 353, 17, 120, 202, 138, 131, 53, 94, 22, 24 ],
  "applications" : [ 825, 108, 560, 25, 325, 593, 417, 375, 191, 393, 373, 341 ],
  "dept" : [ 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6 ],
  "male" : [ 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 ],
  "N" : 12,
  "N_dept" : 6
}
```

Twelve rows (six departments × two genders), so `N = 12` and `N_dept = 6` — matching
the cardinality the `.stan` schema expects. (The arrays are condensed to one line each
here for brevity.)

Clean convergence (`R_hat ≈ 1.00`, no divergences). The result reproduces the classic
Berkeley paradox: once admission rates are allowed to vary by department, the overall
gender slope `b ≈ -0.10` is small and straddles zero — there is no strong
across-the-board male advantage. The department intercepts span a wide range, from the
easy-to-enter `a[1] ≈ 0.67` to the highly selective `a[6] ≈ -2.6`, with a sizeable
between-department spread `sigma ≈ 1.26`.

## 5. Advanced examples

The advanced examples reach the richest DSL constructs — correlated (multivariate)
varying effects, covariance priors, and the matrix-valued parameters they imply.

### 5.1 Cafés — correlated varying slopes (multivariate normal + LKJ)

#### 5.1.1 About the café model

This is McElreath's chapter-14 café waiting-time model. Each café is visited several
times, morning and afternoon, and the wait is modelled with a **per-café intercept and
afternoon slope drawn jointly from a bivariate normal**:

```
wait ~ Normal(mu, sigma)
mu   = a_cafe[cafe] + b_cafe[cafe] * afternoon
[a_cafe[cafe], b_cafe[cafe]] ~ MVNormal([a, b], S)
S = diag(sigma_cafe) · Rho · diag(sigma_cafe)
Rho  ~ LKJcorr(2)
```

It goes beyond the §4 hierarchies in two ways: the two per-café coefficients are
**correlated** (a café with a higher baseline wait may have a different afternoon
effect), and that correlation is itself a parameter — a `cholesky_factor_corr` matrix
with an **LKJ-Cholesky** prior. This exercises the most elaborate part of the
generator: packing `c(a_cafe, b_cafe)` into an `array[N] vector[J]`, a
`multi_normal_cholesky` prior, and `diag_pre_multiply(sigma, L_corr)`.

#### 5.1.2 The `Preliminaries` directory and `stancode`

```
~/Documents/StanCases/cafe/Preliminaries/
├── cafe.alist.r
└── cafe.csv
```

The model description, `cafe.alist.r`:

```r
alist(
	wait ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),
	mu <- a_cafe[cafe] + b_cafe[cafe]*afternoon,
	c(a_cafe,b_cafe)[cafe] ~ dmvnorm2(c(a,b),sigma_cafe,Rho),
	a ~ dnorm(0,10),
	b ~ dnorm(0,10),
	sigma_cafe ~ dcauchy(0,2),
	sigma ~ dcauchy(0,2),
	Rho ~ dlkjcorr(2)
)
```

The `c(a_cafe,b_cafe)[cafe] ~ dmvnorm2(c(a,b), sigma_cafe, Rho)` line is the new
construct: it draws **two** per-café coefficients jointly. McElreath's `dmvnorm2`
takes the means `c(a,b)`, the per-dimension scales `sigma_cafe`, and the correlation
matrix `Rho`.

Generate the Stan source:

```bash
swiftstan stancode --model cafe
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/cafe/Results/cafe.stan
```

The generated `Results/cafe.stan`:

```stan
// Generated by SwiftStan ulam port.
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  int<lower=1> N_cafe;
  vector[N] afternoon;
  array[N] int<lower=1, upper=N_cafe> cafe;
  vector[N] wait;
  int J;
}
parameters {
  array[N_cafe] vector[J] a_cafeb_cafe;
  real a;
  real b;
  vector<lower=0>[J] sigma_cafe;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
  cholesky_factor_corr[J] Rho;
}
model {
  vector[N] mu;
  for (i in 1:N) {
    mu[i] = a_cafeb_cafe[cafe[i]][1] + a_cafeb_cafe[cafe[i]][2]*afternoon[i];
  }
  a_cafeb_cafe ~ multi_normal_cholesky([a, b]', diag_pre_multiply(sigma_cafe, Rho));
  a ~ normal(0, 10);
  b ~ normal(0, 10);
  sigma_cafe ~ cauchy(0, 2) T[0, ];
  sigma ~ cauchy(0, 2) T[0, ];
  Rho ~ lkj_corr_cholesky(2);
  wait ~ normal(mu, sigma);
}
```

A lot happens in the lowering of that one `dmvnorm2` line:

- The two coefficients `c(a_cafe, b_cafe)` are **packed** into a single
  `array[N_cafe] vector[J]` parameter `a_cafeb_cafe` (`J = 2`, the number of stacked
  coefficients). The deterministic `mu` line is rewritten to the packed-and-indexed
  form `a_cafeb_cafe[cafe[i]][1]` / `[2]`, emitted inside a `for` loop.
- `Rho ~ dlkjcorr(2)` becomes a `cholesky_factor_corr[J] Rho` parameter with an
  `lkj_corr_cholesky(2)` prior — and, being multivariate, carries **no** truncation.
- The joint prior is `multi_normal_cholesky([a, b]', diag_pre_multiply(sigma_cafe, Rho))`
  — the scale vector `sigma_cafe` (a `vector<lower=0>[J]`) and the correlation factor
  `Rho` combined the Stan-idiomatic way.
- `J` is a structural constant (`= 2`), not a CSV column, so it is carried to the data
  JSON via a `cafe.scalars.json` sidecar — see the next step.

#### 5.1.3 Running `compile`

```bash
swiftstan compile --model cafe
```

```
→ Command `/usr/bin/make (cafe executable)` completed successfully.
```

#### 5.1.4 Preparing the data with `csv2json`

The first six lines of `cafe.csv` (header plus five of the 60 rows):

```
"","cafe","afternoon","wait"
"1",1,0,3.81
"2",2,0,4.22
"3",3,0,3.95
"4",4,0,4.14
"5",5,0,4.08
```

```bash
swiftstan csv2json --model cafe
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/cafe/Results/cafe.data.json
```

The resulting `cafe.data.json` carries the three CSV-derived arrays plus the derived
cardinalities **and the structural constant `J`**:

```json
{
  "afternoon" : [ … ],
  "cafe" : [ 1, 2, 3, … ],
  "wait" : [ … ],
  "J" : 2,
  "N" : 60,
  "N_cafe" : 6
}
```

`J = 2` is **not** a CSV column — it's the multivariate dimension the model knows
structurally. `stancode` records it in `Results/cafe.scalars.json` (`{"J":2}`) and
`csv2json` merges it into the data JSON, so cmdstan finds the `int J;` its data block
declares. (Without it, sampling would fail with "variable J not found in data.")

#### 5.1.5 Sampling with `sample` (and `stansummary`)

```bash
swiftstan sample --model cafe
```

```
Command `/Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/cafe/Results/cafe sample` completed successfully.

→ Wrote cleaned cafe.stansummary.csv (raw cafe_stansummary.csv preserved)
```

The population means recover the data-generating story: a baseline morning wait
`a ≈ 3.6` and a negative afternoon effect `b ≈ -1.1` (afternoons are faster). The
per-café `a_cafeb_cafe[k,1]`/`[k,2]` pairs cluster tightly around those population
values — the cafés are similar. `Rho[2,1] ≈ -0.10` is the (Cholesky-factor) entry
behind the intercept–slope correlation.

### 5.2 Radon — partial pooling, and the `stan2alist` round-trip

#### 5.2.1 About the partial-pooling radon model

This section completes the radon trilogy. §3.1 fit one intercept shared by every home
(*complete pooling*); §4.1 gave each of the 85 counties its own independent intercept
(*no pooling*). The **partial-pooling** model is the middle ground promised in §4.1.1:
each county still has its own intercept `alpha[county]`, but those intercepts are now
drawn from a common hyper-distribution whose mean and spread are themselves estimated:

```
log_radon ~ Normal(alpha[county] + beta * floor, sigma)
alpha[county] ~ Normal(mu_alpha, sigma_alpha)   (hyper-prior, learned)
mu_alpha, sigma_alpha ~ ...                      (hyper-parameters)
```

Estimating `mu_alpha` and `sigma_alpha` from the data lets information *flow between
counties*: data-poor counties are shrunk toward the overall mean `mu_alpha`, while
data-rich counties stay close to their own estimate.

Rather than hand-write the `"<name>.alist.r"` for this model, this section starts from the other end. A Stan programmer would naturally write this model in idiomatic Stan — reaching for two features the generator does not emit: an `offset`/`multiplier` non-centred parameter and a `generated quantities` posterior-predictive block.

We take exactly such a hand-written file, run it **backwards** through `stan2alist` (§2) to recover an editable `"<name>.alist.r"`, copy that into the `radon_pp` case, and then drive it **forwards** through the
usual `stancode → compile → csv2json → sample` pipeline. The forward Stan that results is byte-for-byte the centred model — demonstrating the `stan → stan2alist → stancode` round-trip end-to-end.

#### 5.2.2 The idiomatic Stan template, and recovering its alist with `stan2alist`

The `radon_pp_template` example ships a hand-written, idiomatic Stan file (and no
`.alist.R` — that is what we are about to generate). `Results/radon_pp_template.stan`:

```stan
data {
  int<lower=1> N;  // observations
  int<lower=1> N_county;
  array[N] int<lower=1, upper=N_county> county;
  vector[N] floor;
  vector[N] log_radon;
}
parameters {
  real mu_alpha;
  real<lower=0> sigma_alpha;
  vector<offset=mu_alpha, multiplier=sigma_alpha>[N_county] alpha;
  real beta;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
}
model {
  log_radon ~ normal(alpha[county] + beta * floor, sigma);
  alpha ~ normal(mu_alpha, sigma_alpha); // partial-pooling
  beta ~ normal(0, 10);
  sigma ~ normal(0, 10);
  mu_alpha ~ normal(0, 10);
  sigma_alpha ~ normal(0, 10);
}
generated quantities {
  array[N] real y_rep = normal_rng(alpha[county] + beta * floor, sigma);
}
```

The `offset`/`multiplier` declaration is a **non-centred** parameterisation (it samples
the funnel geometry of `alpha`/`sigma_alpha` more cleanly), and the `generated
quantities` block draws posterior-predictive replicates `y_rep`. Run the reverse
pipeline to recover an editable `alist()` from it:

```bash
swiftstan stan2alist --model radon_pp_template
```

```
stan2alist: warning: dropped Stan block 'generated quantities' — no alist representation; not translated
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/radon_pp_template/Preliminaries/radon_pp_template.alist.R
```

The recovered `Preliminaries/radon_pp_template.alist.R`:

```r
alist(
  log_radon ~ dnorm(alpha[county] + beta * floor, sigma),
  alpha[county] ~ dnorm(mu_alpha, sigma_alpha),
  beta ~ dnorm(0, 10),
  sigma ~ dnorm(0, 10),
  mu_alpha ~ dnorm(0, 10),
  sigma_alpha ~ dnorm(0, 10)
)
```

The two Stan features the template adds carry no `alist()` form and are deliberately
reduced on the way back:

- The `vector<offset=mu_alpha, multiplier=sigma_alpha>[N_county] alpha;` non-centred
  declaration is **stripped to the centred form**. The non-centred and centred
  parameterisations are statistically equivalent, and `stancode` only emits the centred
  one, so dropping the affine transform is exactly what makes the round-trip consistent.
- The `generated quantities` block has **no `alist()` form and is dropped with the
  stderr warning** shown above — `alist()` describes the model, not derived posterior
  quantities.

(`stan2alist` refuses to overwrite an existing `.alist.R` unless `--force` is given; the
`radon_pp_template` example ships without one, so the command runs clean.)

#### 5.2.3 Seeding the `radon_pp` case

The recovered alist *is* the partial-pooling model in McElreath form. Copy it into the
`radon_pp` case, renaming it to match:

```bash
cp ~/Documents/StanCases/radon_pp_template/Preliminaries/radon_pp_template.alist.R \
   ~/Documents/StanCases/radon_pp/Preliminaries/radon_pp.alist.R
```

`radon_pp/Preliminaries/` now holds the inputs the forward pipeline needs:

```
~/Documents/StanCases/radon_pp/Preliminaries/
├── radon_pp.alist.R
└── radon_pp.csv
```

`radon_pp.csv` is the same full radon dataset used in §4.1; the model references
`county`, `floor`, and `log_radon`. Compared with the no-pooling §4.1 alist, the only
change is the second line: where §4.1 wrote `alpha[county] ~ dnorm(0, 10)` (a fixed
prior), here the prior's parameters are the *free* variables `mu_alpha` and
`sigma_alpha`, which then get their own priors — the substitution that turns independent
intercepts into partially-pooled ones.

#### 5.2.4 Generating Stan with `stancode`

```bash
swiftstan stancode --model radon_pp
```

```
→ Wrote /Users/rob/Documents/StanCases/radon_pp/Results/radon_pp.stan
```

The generated `Results/radon_pp.stan`:

```stan
// Generated by SwiftStan ulam port.
data {
  int<lower=1> N;
  int<lower=1> N_county;
  array[N] int<lower=1, upper=N_county> county;
  vector[N] floor;
  vector[N] log_radon;
}
parameters {
  vector[N_county] alpha;
  real beta;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
  real mu_alpha;
  real<lower=0> sigma_alpha;
}
model {
  alpha ~ normal(mu_alpha, sigma_alpha);
  beta ~ normal(0, 10);
  sigma ~ normal(0, 10) T[0, ];
  mu_alpha ~ normal(0, 10);
  sigma_alpha ~ normal(0, 10) T[0, ];
  log_radon ~ normal(alpha[county] + beta*floor, sigma);
}
```

The varying intercept `alpha` is a `vector[N_county]`, exactly as in §4.1, but its
prior `alpha ~ normal(mu_alpha, sigma_alpha)` now references two free parameters. Both
standard-deviation hyper-parameters (`sigma`, `sigma_alpha`) carry the `<lower=0>`
constraint and the half-normal `T[0, ]` truncation the classifier derives from their
positivity.

This is the **centred** parameterisation — and that closes the loop opened in §5.2.2:
the hand-written `radon_pp_template.stan` was non-centred, `stan2alist` reduced it to the
centred alist, and `stancode` here regenerates the centred Stan. `stan → stan2alist →
stancode` round-trips for this vectorising model.

#### 5.2.5 Running `compile`

```bash

Writes the `radon_pp` binary and the compile logs into `Results/`, as in §3.1.3.

```

```

As in §4.1, the string `county` column is factorised to 1-based indices and the
matching cardinality is emitted:

```json

  "floor" : [ … ],
  "log_radon" : [ … ],

The effect of partial pooling is visible against §4.1: the shared slope `beta ≈ -0.66`
and noise `sigma ≈ 0.73` are essentially unchanged, but the county intercepts are now
shrunk toward the learned mean `mu_alpha ≈ 1.5` with estimated between-county spread
`sigma_alpha ≈ 0.32`. Data-poor `alpha[1]` (StdDev ≈ 0.25) is pulled in noticeably
harder than under no pooling (where its StdDev was ≈ 0.37), while data-rich `alpha[2]`
barely moves — exactly the borrowing-of-strength partial pooling is meant to provide.

After sampling, `Results/` mirrors the radon layout (§3.1.5), with `radon_pp.*`
filenames.

## 6. Future work

The pipeline and this manual are still growing. Planned additions:

- **Non-centred parameterisation** for correlated/hierarchical models. The café model
  (§5.1) is emitted in the centred form, whose funnel geometry samples imperfectly;
  a non-centred reparameterisation (offset + scaled `z`) would converge cleanly.
- **More advanced worked examples** — Gaussian processes, ordered-logit / monotonic
  effects, and Wishart covariance priors. The DSL constructs exist; they aren't yet
  documented end-to-end here.
- **Crossed random effects with distinct group cardinalities.** The current port
  shares a single vector-length symbol (`J`); models with several independent grouping
  dimensions need per-group symbols.
- **Indexed bare-LHS deterministics** (`mu[i] <- …`). Today only plain-identifier
  deterministic targets are rewritten; an explicitly indexed target would need its own
  loop-body emitter.
- **Staleness-aware `compile`.** `compile` currently skips when a binary exists; it
  does not yet recompile when the `.stan` is newer than the binary (regenerate by
  removing the binary, or via the `ulam` pipeline's `isStale` checks).
