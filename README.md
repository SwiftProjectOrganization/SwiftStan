# SwiftStan

1. A macOS / Xcode / Swift CLI wrapping Stan's [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_37/cmdstan-guide/).

2. An experimental port of [McElreath](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919)'s R implementation ulam() in [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) to Swift.

- [`Docs/CLAUDE.md`](Docs/CLAUDE.md) — architecture notes (loaded by Claude Code sessions in this workspace).
- [`Docs/TODO.md`](Docs/TODO.md) — forward-looking punch list for topics implemented and possible future work/refinements to do.[](()
